Hands-on architect and leader with 20+ years experience solving challenging technology problems at global scale. I really enjoy the innovation process, taking concepts from idea to solution.

I started writing code in the 1980's on an [Atari 800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family){:target="_blank"}, although my favorite machine has always been the [Amiga](https://arstechnica.com/series/history-of-the-amiga/){:target="_blank"} - _which I hear might be [making a comeback](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/17/08/12/0411240/a-new-amiga-will-go-on-sale-in-late-2017){:target="_blank"}_. Since then, I've worked on a wide variety of Unix, Linux and Windows platforms, numerous development languages and software architectures. Most recently, I've been focused heavily on using [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps){:target="_blank"} and [Container Technologies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncf/landscape/master/landscape/CloudNativeLandscape_latest.jpg){:target="_blank"} to run [Microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html){:target="_blank"} in the [Cloud](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2011/10/final-version-nist-cloud-computing-definition-published){:target="_blank"}. A short list of specific technical interests below.

PS - Also very interested in Machine Learning, but I admit I need to re-learn some math to be good at it.
